Primer editing analysis scripts

Scripts for analyzing primer editing data used in the publication entitled: "Dissecting and Tuning Primer Editing by Proofreading Polymerases"

"..._primer_mismatches.py" and "..._primer_mismatches_reverse_primer.py" scripts were used in the analysis to generate the Observed edits/Expected edits metrics reported in the paper figures.

"..._primer_base_counts.py" scripts were used to double check the primer mismatches analysis and generated results that were consistent with the Observed edits/Expected edits metrics reported in the paper figures.
